"Do not try and bend the spoon. That's impossible. Instead... only try to realize the truth."

Someone incepted the password for the next stop in one of these directories.
It sure would take a long time to look through all of them. There has to be a better way...

Even once you have the credentials (which are correct), you might have trouble logging into the 
Forth Stop. Perhaps they are blocking your IP?

Helpful commands: grep, find, cat, man, nmap
